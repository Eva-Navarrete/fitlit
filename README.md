## Overview and Project Goals
The [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/intention-timer-group.html) of this group project that was made for Mod1 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) is to build a fitness tracking app from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

## Why was this project created?
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:
1. Writing clean and DRY HTML, CSS, and JS
2. Learn fetch calls and how client-server interactions work
3. Learn iterator methods and class to class interaction
4. Learn mocha and chai testing
5. Learn how to create a responsive layout across mobile and desktop devices

## Features
* A website that allows users to keep track of their activity, hydration, and sleep data. With a fun flip card feature that shows more information on hover. This way we can display more information overall without overloading the user with too much information at once.
