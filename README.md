The details of this project are outline in [project spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html).

## Setup

1. Within your group, decide on one person to have the project repository (repo) on their GitHub account. Then, that person should fork this repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.
1. Both memebers of the group should clone down the _forked_ repo. Since you don't want to name your project "activity-tracker-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
1. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page)
1. Make sure both members of your team are collaborators on the forked repo.

## Testing

There is no boilerplate for testing in this starter-kit repo. You will need to set this up yourself. However, if you ran `npm install`, then the tooling you need to start testing is already installed (`mocha` and `chai`).


## Overview and Project Goals
The [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/intention-timer-group.html) of this group project that was made for Mod1 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) is to build a Intention Timer from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

## Why was this project created?
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:
1. writing clean and DRY HTML, CSS, and JS
2. understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
3. the interaction between multiple class files
4. implementation of client-side data persistence by utilizing JSON and localStorage

## Features
* A website that allows users to set a timer for one of three selected activities. User can input the description of their activity and select a time of duration that they would like to take part in.
* User can log that activity and add as many activities as they would like.
